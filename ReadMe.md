## GptChatBot
---
I did it for myself. Easy integration of ChatGPT into telegram chat.

What it does:
1. Respond to user requests by handling everything in the 3.5-turbo model.
2. Don't crash on errors with an intolerant request.
3. Self-repair when errors occur, also writing them down.
4. Keep you company when you're feeling particularly lonely.

There is potential for scaling, although further development is preferable on the 4+ model, as 3.5 just has an outdated database.
